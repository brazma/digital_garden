# How to single crochet

**Abbreviation: Sc or sc**
![[single_crochet_rect.png]]
At last, it’s time for some actual crochet! Single crochet is the simplest crochet stitch, and the smallest. It’s the building block for amigurumi toys, and heavily employed for projects that need strong, dense fabric, like dish cloths, coasters and reusable face scrubbies. To make a little sample of single crochet:

- Make a foundation chain 11 stitches long (10 spaces for single crochet stitches + 1 turning chain).
- Skip the first chain stitch and insert the hook through the 2nd chain stitch from the hook (1 & 2). If you skipped ahead to get here, and now you’re not quite sure which bit of the chain stitch to insert the hook through, go back to [[chain stitch]]

- Loop your yarn over the hook from back to front (3).
- Use the hook to pull that loop of yarn through the chain stitch. Keep it on the hook! You have two loops on your hook now (4).
- Loop your yarn over the hook from back to front again (5).
- Use the hook to pull that loop through both of the other loops (6). Your first single crochet is complete!

Here’s that process in video form (by the way, none of these videos have sound – don’t adjust your volume control!)

Make another single crochet into each of the 9 stitches remaining on your foundation chain. This first row will probably curl up in a corkscrew as you go, but don’t worry, it will straighten out when you make the second row. In fact making a single twisty row is a popular technique in [amigurumi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9T8F2sxcq4&t=20s) for adding details like hair or sheep wool! When you get to the end of the foundation chain, count your stitches to make sure you have as many as you expected – the last space on your foundation chain can be easy to miss!

## Turning your work

Congratulations, you’ve made your first row of crochet stitches – you’re officially a crocheter! Next you’re going to turn your work, and make another row going back in the other direction.

- First, make a turning chain of one chain stitch.
- Turn the first row 180° counterclockwise. The working yarn should come down in front of your work you’ve done so far.

Which way you turn your work isn’t actually as important as being consistent and turning it the same way every time, but I’m adamant that turning it counterclockwise produces neater sides. To begin a new row, insert the hook under both top loops of the last stitch from the previous row, and then follow the steps to make a single crochet.

Don’t forget to make another turning chain at the end of the row before starting row 3!

## Moving on

Now you’ve mastered the single crochet stitch, all the other stitches you’ll ever need are really easy to pick up! The basic stitch mechanics – putting the yarn over the hook, and drawing through loops – are the same for all crochet stitches. All that changes is how many yarn overs and drawing through loops you do, and in what order.
