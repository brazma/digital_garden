# Treble crochet

**Also known as: Triple crochet**  
**Abbreviation: Tr or tr**

[![treble crochet sample](https://lucykatecrochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/basic-crochet-stitches-LCC-image-19.jpg)](https://lucykatecrochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/basic-crochet-stitches-LCC-image-19.jpg)

Since double crochet is twice the height of single crochet, it’s going to come as no surprise to you that treble crochet is three times the height of single crochet. It’s a talllllll stitch! And as it’s so tall – and bearing in mind it’s only attached to its neighbors at the top and bottom – it’s also noticeably gappy between the stitches. The gaps make it a little less versatile than the other stitches we’ve looked at so far, but it’s vital for creating space in lacy crochet patterns.

Here’s how to make a sample. I’m going to mix things up and show you the video first this time!

- Chain 13 or 14 (10 spaces for stitches, and [3 or 4 turning chains](https://lucykatecrochet.com/understanding-basic-crochet-techniques-and-stitches#turning)). I’m using three turning chains.
- Put the yarn over the hook twice.
- Insert the hook into the 4th chain from the hook (5th if you’re using 4 turning chains).
- Yarn over the hook, and draw a loop through the chain stitch. Now you have 4 loops on your hook in total.
- Yarn over the hook again, and draw it through 2 of the loops on your hook. 3 loops remaining on your hook.
- Put the yarn over again, and draw it through the next 2 loops. 2 loops remaining on the hook.
- Yarn over the hook one last time, and draw it through those last two loops.

To add another row, make 3 or 4 turning chains, and turn your work 180° counterclockwise. Skip the turning chains, put the yarn over the hook twice, and insert the hook under the top loops of the last stitch from the previous row to begin your first stitch.
