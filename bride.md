double crochet sample

Double crochet is an absolute workhorse of a crochet stitch. It’s what traditional granny squares are made out of, not to mention countless decorative stitches like ripple stitch and waffle stitch. It’s a stalwart of blankets, scarves, and clothes. Double crochet is roughly twice the height of single crochet, and the same width. Which is what makes it so popular – you’ll cover the same area in half as many stitches as would need to make using single crochet!

To make a swatch:

- Chain 12 or 13 (10 spaces for stitches, and [2 or 3 turning chains](https://lucykatecrochet.com/#turning)). I’m using two turning chains.
- Bring the yarn over the hook from back to front.
- Insert the hook into the 3rd chain from the hook (4th if you’re using 3 turning chains).
- Yarn over, and draw a loop through the chain stitch. Now you’ll have 3 loops on your hook in total.
- Yarn over, and draw it through 2 of the loops on your hook. 2 loops remaining on your hook.
- Yarn over, and draw it through both remaining loops.

Here’s a video of that in action:

And here’s how the first finished row will look:

one row of double crochet

To start the next row, make 2 or 3 turning chains, and turn your work 180° counterclockwise. Skip the turning chains, put the yarn over the hook, and insert the hook under the top loops of the last stitch from the previous row to begin your first stitch.
