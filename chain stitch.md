# How to crochet chain stitch

**Abbreviation: Ch** **or ch**

Lots of crochet projects start with a foundation chain, so that’s where we’re going to start too. A foundation chain is simply lots of chain stitches made in a row, into which the first row of crochet stitches will be made. Chain stitch is about as simple as crochet gets too, so it’s the perfect place to get to grips with controlling your yarn and hook.

Here’s a video showing how it’s done, with written instructions and step-by-step photos after:

- Cast on with a slip knot, and get your hook and yarn in position.
- Use the middle finger and thumb of your yarn-holding-hand to pinch the slip knot or the yarn tail, and hold it steady.
- Loop the yarn over your hook, from back to front. Once you’re making this movement confidently, you’ll probably find you’re moving the yarn up and over a bit, *and* the hook down and under a bit (1). But don’t overthink how you get there at the moment – fluidity will come with repetition!

- Line up the hooked end of your crochet hook ready to catch the yarn (2).
- Pull the yarn through your slip knot (3). And that’s it – chain stitch complete (4).
- Put the yarn over the hook from front to back again, and pull another loop through the loop already on your hook. That’s two chain stitches.
- Keep practising, until you can make lots of evenly sized chain stitches in a steady motion.

## Anatomy of a chain stitch

Before we forge ahead with putting some crochet stitches in our foundation chain, let’s examine her a bit more closely. I bet you think she looks boring, huh? Well you won’t be saying that when you’re trying to work out where your first stitch goes.

Each chain has three parts: 
a top front loop, a top back loop, and a back loop underneath.

For the majority of projects, you’ll work the first row of crochet into the top back loops only. That leaves the top front loops free for joining the bottom edge to another piece of crochet later. But some people like to make their first row of stitches into the back loops. It’s a bit fiddly, but it leaves both of the top loops free an extra-strong join later. Have a go at both and see what you prefer – for the rest of the examples here, I’m going to use the top back loops only, because I prefer that.
