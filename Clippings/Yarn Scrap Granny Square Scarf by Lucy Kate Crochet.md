This free yarn scrap granny square scarf pattern is a great way to use up your partial skeins, and make a gorgeous item of crocheted clothing in the process. It’s beginner friendly and you can use pretty much any yarn type. This project will help you to use up that precious scrap yarn in a fun and productive way.

- [The pattern](https://lucykatecrochet.com/#pattern)
- [Joining your granny squares together](https://lucykatecrochet.com/#sew)
- [Creating a border](https://lucykatecrochet.com/#border)

I have laid this design out in clear steps, so that even someone [brand new to crocheting](https://lucykatecrochet.com/how-do-i-learn-to-crochet) should have no trouble following along.

I made this crochet scarf from [yarn skeins](https://lucykatecrochet.com/best-yarn-for-crochet-scarf) left over from my [recent crochet plushie designs](https://lucykatecrochet.com/crochet-patterns). I hate waste, and I love crocheted scarves. What could be better!

I made four different color changes within my scarf. So three [granny squares](https://lucykatecrochet.com/how-to-crochet-a-blanket-with-multiple-granny-squares) are identical, and the remaining three squares all differ. This enabled me to work with the yarn I had left over, although I still had some nerve wracking yarn chicken moments finishing the edges!

## Yarn Scraps, Hooks and More

The partial scrap skeins I used to make this scarf included four [different aran yarns](https://lucykatecrochet.com/yarn-for-crochet).

- Brown aran yarn (first color)
- Yellow aran yarn (second color)
- Mixed cream aran yarn (third color)
- Cream aran yarn (fourth color)
- 5mm crochet hook
- Yarn needle (optional for sewing in the ends)

Because this [pattern is designed](https://lucykatecrochet.com/how-to-design-crochet-patterns) for using up your scrap skeins of yarn, you can swap any colors you like over. So in the pattern I’ve given you instructions noting both the colors I used, by numbering the colors too so if you’re using different ones you can still easily follow along.

## Sewing Granny Squares Together

![granny square scarf sewing](https://lucykatecrochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/granny-square-scarf-squares.jpg)

granny square scarf sewing

Take your squares and put them into an order that you’re happy with. Lay them out on a hard surface, and then turn them upside down. The rougher side should be facing you.

Cast your cream or fourth colored yarn onto your hook. Put your hook through the first set of adjoining corner spaces, so that both granny squares are hanging on the same hook. Yarn over, pull the yarn through the gaps, yarn over again, and pull through both loops.

Repeat this motion moving through every pair of stitches, corner to corner.

You’re going to join each set of squares in the same fashion.

## Crocheting Your Border

There are some fabulous, [complex ways to create crochet borders](https://lucykatecrochet.com/crochet-blanket-borders). But I went for something simple for this design, due to the unknown quantities of yarn! If you’ve made your out of scraps from incomplete skeins I recommend you following these simple instructions to reduce the odds of running out half way around. But go nuts with something a bit more fancy if you’re feeling flush with yarn!

![sewing border for the granny square scarf](https://lucykatecrochet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/granny-square-scarf-1.jpg)

Cast onto your crochet hook, and insert it into one of the corner spaces. Chain three as your first double crochet, then make two further double crochets into the corner.

Moving along the edge of the scarf, make a double crochet into each stitch.

At each corner, make three double crochets.

When you reach your starting point, slip stitch into the top of your initial chain three.

You can stop here, or add another set of stitches to the narrow end sections of the scarf.

## Finishing The Ends

To give the scarf a more complete look, I lengthened the narrow ends of the piece.

Insert your hook into the corner stitch, and make a single crochet, then double crochet along then end, putting one final single crochet into the corner stitch.

Repeat for both ends, then sew in your loose threads of yarn with a yarn needle or hook as you prefer.

## Your Yarn Scrap Scarf

You are unlikely to have the exact same leftover skeins as I do, and so your scarf is probably going to be a little different to mine. And that’s great! One of the best things about handmade items is that even when they follow the same pattern, they are always a little unique.

**Happy Crocheting!**
