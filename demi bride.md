# Half double crochet

**Abbreviation: Hdc or hdc**

![[Pasted image 20260108185919.png]]
Half double crochet is a little taller, and a fraction wider than single crochet. On its own it makes a soft, dense fabric that’s popular for hats and sweaters. To make a sample:

- Chain 12 (10 spaces for stitches, and 2 turning chains).
- Put the yarn over the hook from back to front.
- Insert the hook into the 3rd chain from the hook.
- Put the yarn over the hook again.
- Grab the yarn with the hook and draw a loop through the chain stitch. You’ll have 3 loops on your hook.
- Put the yarn over the hook again, and draw it through all 3 loops. Stitch complete!
- Repeat in the remaining 9 chains.

one row of half double crochet

- Make 2 turning chains, and turn your work counterclockwise.
- To begin the next row, skip the 2 turning chains, and insert the hook under both top loops of the last stitch from the previous row. Complete the row as before.

Here’s a video of half double crochet in action:

You might have noticed in these videos that I use the forefinger of my hook-holding hand to pinch the yarn against the side of the hook during motions. This isn’t necessary, and I’m pretty sure it’s even considered bad form by some crocheters. But it’s how I’ve always done it! You don’t have to do it if you can manipulate the yarn confidently without doing it. It’s all about finding what works for you, so that crochet is fun for you.
