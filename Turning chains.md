# Turning chains

The next thing to get to grips with are turning chains. Turning chains are little groups of chain stitches at the beginning of every row. They create height for the crochet stitches that follow them.

- **Single crochet** needs **1 turning chain** at the start of the row.
- **Half double crochet** needs **2 turning chains** at the start of a row.
- **Double crochet** needs **2 or 3 turning chains**. Three is traditional, but it’s increasingly common to find patterns which only call for two. All I can say is, experiment, and find what works for you! If your tension is naturally on the loose side, two might be enough, and three might look baggy. If your tension is tight, you might need three to get enough height.
- **Treble crochet** needs **3 or 4 turning chains**. As for double crochet, either follow the instructions in the pattern, or experiment to see which gives the tidiest edges for you – it might vary according to the yarn and hook you’re using.

You’ll also need to add turning chains to the end of your foundation chain, before you make your first row. So if you want to make a double crochet scarf 30 stitches wide, you’ll need to start with a foundation chain of 32 or 33 stitches. If you’re following a pattern, the pattern writer will usually include the turning chains for the first row in the number of foundation chains they tell you to make.
